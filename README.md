# Insight-project
At Insight Data Science, I consulted for a talent-matching company called Shortlist. They try to match job seekers with hiring companies based on the job titles the clients enter.
Job titles can be ambiguous sometimes. For a person, a recuirter can be called as talent acquisition but another person might call it a hiring manager. 
I built a model to normalize job titles to automate this process so for "talent acquisition", "hiring manager" or "recruiting manager", the model will return "recruiter" for all.
